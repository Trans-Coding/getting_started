Set environmental variables for startup of Apache server with Windows



Mac Apache installation

First make a directory in your home directory called Sites, using the terminal, you can do this with the following

$ mkdir ~/Sites

In this directory is where we will clone our repositories. 
We’ll need to tell Apache to recognize this as a directory. We must create a configuration file in the apache system area. Using the terminal, let’s see what our user name is

$ whoami


When I run this command, my username is jay. With this name, we must create the config file.

$ sudo touch /etc/apache2/users/{{USERNAME}}.conf

Replace {{USERNAME}} with your respective username. We now need to set up a few configurations.
Open the file found here with the following command

$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/users/{{USERNAME}}.conf

In this file, type or copy/paste the following:

<Directory "/Users/{{USERNAME}}/Sites/">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

Let’s make sure our permissions are right, run the following

$ sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/users/{{USERNAME}}.conf

If you receive an error, refer to:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10873295/error-message-forbidden-you-dont-have-permission-to-access-on-this-server

Let’s now edit the main apache configuration file. Use the following command to open the file

$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

With the file open, look for the following lines of code, they may be spread across the file. Make sure they are uncommented. E.g. Make sure they do not have a # in front of it.

LoadModule authz_host_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_host.so
LoadModule authz_core_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_core.so
LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so
LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/apache2/mod_vhost_alias.so
LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so


Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

To find these lines, I did a search and made sure to remove the # 
You can use control+W to enter search mode in nano.
We now need to make changes so that apache will recognize the folder we made under “Sites” as websites to be displayed. 

Edit the file with the following:

$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf

Look for the following and remove the # in front of it.

Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf

Run the following command to get PHP 7.2
curl -s https://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 7.2

Now restart apache with:
sudo apachectl restart
