Jade Selke

Brief Overview

I extended this page from my site as if it were running on Laravel's MVC architecture. The main view is built in show.blade.php. The model and controller are both labeled as such, Application.php and ApplicationController.php. The .sql file that would be needed for creation of the table, insertion and selection is also provided. A calculator is included to show usage of the Factory Method in the creation of a complex mortgage amortization table. For a demo of the page, simply load up the page as http://localhost/{location-of-file}/show.blade.php
